# Spring Boot Feature Showcase API

A modular **Spring Boot REST API** built to demonstrate the implementation of various backend features.  
This project started as a simple in-memory CRUD API and will be expanded to include database integration, authentication, and caching.

## âœ¨ Current Features

- **User CRUD Operations** â€” Create, Read, Update, Delete users  
- **In-memory storage** using `HashMap`  
- **Validation**:
  - Email format check
  - Duplicate email prevention
  - UUID format validation
- **Custom exception handling** with proper HTTP status codes:
  - `400 Bad Request`
  - `404 Not Found`
  - `409 Conflict`
- **RESTful endpoint design** with clean separation of Controller, Service, and Repository layers

## ðŸš€ Planned Features

- **Relational/NoSQL database integration** (MySQL / MongoDB)  
- **JWT-based authentication & authorization**  
- **Role-based access control** (admin, user)  
- **Redis caching** for performance optimization  
- **Cache invalidation strategies**  
- **Standardized API responses** with `@RestControllerAdvice`
